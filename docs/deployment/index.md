# Deployment Guide

This section provides comprehensive guides for deploying Open Notebook in different environments, from simple local setups to production deployments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**New to Open Notebook?** Start with the [Docker Setup Guide](docker.md) - it's the fastest way to get up and running.

## üìã Deployment Options

### 1. [Docker Deployment](docker.md)
**Recommended for most users**
- Complete beginner-friendly guide
- Single-container and multi-container options
- Supports all major AI providers
- Perfect for local development and testing

### 2. [Cloud Platform Deployment](cloud-platforms.md)
**Best for production hosting**
- Railway, Render, DigitalOcean, AWS guides
- Managed services with automatic SSL
- Scalable and production-ready
- Step-by-step platform-specific instructions

### 3. [Single Container Deployment](single-container.md)
**Best for platforms like PikaPods**
- All-in-one container solution
- Simplified deployment process
- Ideal for cloud hosting platforms
- Lower resource requirements

### 4. [Development Setup](development.md)
**For contributors and advanced users**
- Local development environment
- Source code installation
- Development tools and debugging
- Contributing to the project

### 5. [Reverse Proxy Configuration](reverse-proxy.md)
**For production deployments with custom domains**
- nginx, Caddy, Traefik configurations
- Custom domain setup
- SSL/HTTPS configuration
- Runtime API URL configuration

### 6. [Security Configuration](security.md)
**Essential for public deployments**
- Multi-user authentication setup
- Password protection and best practices
- Production deployment considerations
- Troubleshooting security issues

### 7. [Production Checklist](production-checklist.md)
**Complete pre-launch verification**
- Security configuration checklist
- Performance optimization guide
- Monitoring and backup setup
- Maintenance procedures

## üéØ Choose Your Deployment Method

### Use Docker Setup if:
- You're new to Open Notebook
- You want the easiest setup experience
- You need multiple AI provider support
- You're running locally or on a private server

### Use Cloud Platform Deployment if:
- You want production-ready hosting
- You need automatic SSL and custom domains
- You want managed infrastructure
- You're deploying for team or public use

### Use Single Container if:
- You're deploying on PikaPods or similar platforms
- You want the simplest possible deployment
- You have resource constraints
- You don't need to scale services independently

### Use Reverse Proxy Setup if:
- You're deploying with a custom domain
- You need HTTPS/SSL encryption
- You're using nginx, Caddy, or Traefik
- You want to expose only specific ports publicly

### Use Development Setup if:
- You want to contribute to the project
- You need to modify the source code
- You're developing integrations or plugins
- You want to understand the codebase
